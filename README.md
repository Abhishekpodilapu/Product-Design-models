Worked on designing 3D models of parts like Go kart chassis, Spur gear, helical spring, Screw jack.
Analysis of designed models to check the Total deformation and Equivalent stress of product by varying materials.
Best material suitable for manufacturing is determined based on the values obtained.
Software used: Solid works, AutoCAD, ANSYS Workbench
